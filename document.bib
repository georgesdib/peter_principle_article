@article{petercomp,
  Abstract = {In the late sixties the Canadian psychologist Laurence J. Peter advanced
  an appar- ently paradoxical principle, named since then after him,
  which can be summarized as follows: 'Every new member in a hierarchical
  organization climbs the hierarchy until he/she reaches his/her level
  of maximum incompetence'. Despite its apparent unreasonableness,
  such a principle would realistically act in any organization where
  the mechanism of promotion rewards the best members and where the
  mechanism at their new level in the hierarchical structure does not
  depend on the competence they had at the previous level, usually
  because the tasks of the levels are very dif- ferent to each other.
  Here we show, by means of agent based simulations, that if the latter
  two features actually hold in a given model of an organization with
  a hierarchical structure, then not only is the Peter principle unavoidable,
  but also it yields in turn a significant reduction of the global
  efficiency of the organization. Within a game theory-like approach,
  we explore different promotion strategies and we find, counterintuitively,
  that in order to avoid such an effect the best ways for improving
  the efficiency of a given organization are either to promote each
  time an agent at random or to promote randomly the best and the worst
  members in terms of competence.},

@article{lazear,
  Abstract = {Many have observed that individuals perform worse after having received
  a promotion. The most famous statement of the idea is the Peter Principle,
  which states that people are promoted to their level of incompetence.
  There are a number of possible explanations. Two are explored. The
  most traditional is that the prospect of promotion provides incentives
  which vanish after the promotion has been granted; thus, tenured
  faculty slack off. Another is that output as a statistical matter
  is expected to fall. Being promoted is evidence that a standard has
  been met. Regression to themean implies that future productivity
  will decline on average. Firms optimally account for the regression
  bias in making promotion decisions, but the effect is never eliminated.
  Both explanations are analyzed. The statistical point always holds;
  the slacking off story holds only under certain compensation structures.},

  Abstract = {We provide a technical report on a computer simulation of general
  effectiveness of a hierarchical organization depending on two main
  aspects: effects of promotion to managerial levels and efforts to
  self-promote of individual employees, reducing their actual productivity.
  The combination of judgment by appearance in the promotion to higher
  levels of hierarchy and the Peter Principle (which states that people
  are promoted to their level of incompetence) results in fast declines
  in effectiveness of the organization. The model uses a few synthetic
  parameters aimed at reproduction of realistic conditions in typical
  multilayer organizations.},

@article{logistic,
  Abstract = {In this work we consider the Peter principle and anti-Peter principle as the discrete logistic and discrete inverse logistic equation. Especially we discuss imprecisely estimated (by hierarchical control mechanism) carrying capacity, i.e. boundary (in)competence level of a hierarchy member. It implies that Peter principle holds two sub-principles. In the first one objective boundary competence level is increased for estimation error. In the second one objective boundary competence level is decreased for estimation error. Similarly, anti-Peter principle holds two sub-principles too. All this implies that paradoxical situations that follow from Peter and anti-Peter principle can be simply removed by decrease of the error of hierarchical (social) control. Also we discuss cases by Peter principle when error of the boundary competence level by estimation grows up. (Then, in fact, there is no estimation error but stimulation of the boundary level by control mechanism.) By first Peter subprinciple it implies anarchy in the social structure or, correspondingly, cancer in the biology and medicine, schizophrenia in the psychology and inflation in the economy. By second Peter sub-principle it implies a totalitary social structure (dictature or caste regime) or multiplex sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases in biology and medicine, servile mentality or low value complex in psychology and depression by hyperactive political influences in economy. Finally, monotonus changes of the stimulated part of boundary level cause corresponding phase transitions discussed on the example of the introspection in the psychology.},
